# tap-api

This is the server side code for a full stack: [AWA](http://awa.uts.edu.au), a web application for Academic Writing Analytics. The application was developed by the [Connected Intelligence Centre](http://utscic.edu.au), with the original software developed by [Andrew Gibson](http://GitHub.com/andrewresearch).
 
 This repo provides the REST API for the [AWA client]().

### Quick Start

1. The steps to getting the tap-api running locally...

2. Connecting to ```http://localhost:8080/v1/health``` should return json...

```json
{
  "message": "ok"
}
```
